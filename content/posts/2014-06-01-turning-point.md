Since I learned to develop, there is one thing I never asked myself:

> Why do I work on my personal projects during the night?

I love having personal projects, this is not the problem. What is interesting in this question is its last part: *during the night*. 

Until now, I was working at my job all the day, then, after having rested a bit watching  TV with my girlfriend, was working again on my own stuff. I always felt productive like this, because I consumed many nightly hours like this.

Some days ago, a colleague told me about a book he reads: [The Power of Less](http://thepowerofless.com/) from Leo Babauta, who gives tons of good advices on his site [zenhabits](http://zenhabits.net/).
In this book, Leo Babauta describes how good it is to work on personal projects early, before going to work. 

Seduced by some of his ideas, I decided to give it a try. Instead of enumerating these ideas, I will give the changes I noticed personally:

* I'm more concentrated, and more efficient the morning, because I don't have the weight of one work day
* Having a time limit requires me to time-box tasks and to be more productive
* Starting the day with something important for me is much better
* Surprisingly, it's easier to disconnect from my projects when I have to go to work
* I start then to work at my job fully-awake (Well, this is really good for the image you give to your colleagues)
* I'm not tired during my work day
* I feel sooo much better the night because I don't want to work at all, and this change everything. When I take time to rest, I don't have regrets
    
This is a real change in my life, I really feel better in my daily routine. Apart from that, I decided to change other things, like doing more sports. Being a developer is not a valid excuse for not taking care of me.
Plus, I also (re)started to write my blog.

Now, hopefully, I will be able to maintain these changes, and this blog, and you will continue to read me!
